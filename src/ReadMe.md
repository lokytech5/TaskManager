Enter task priority (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW).
After entering the details, the task will be added, and you'll see a confirmation message.

**Removing a Task:**

Choose **2. Remove Task** and enter the name of the task you want to remove. After successful removal, a confirmation message will be displayed.

... (and so on for each feature).
